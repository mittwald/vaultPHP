## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security-related issue or vulnerability in any of our codebase, please report it to our security team by sending an email to security@mittwald.de.

To ensure a prompt response, please include as much detail as possible about the issue in your report, including steps to reproduce the issue if possible. Our security team will investigate the issue and respond to you as soon as possible.

## Reminder

We would like to remind you to be responsible and not disclose any vulnerabilities publicly. Disclosing vulnerabilities publicly can put our users' data at risk and create opportunities for malicious actors to exploit the vulnerability. Therefore, we ask that you keep any vulnerabilities you discover confidential until they are resolved.
